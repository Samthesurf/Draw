# Drawing the YouTube Logo with CSS and HTML
This project was inspired by the CSS and HTML tutorials of Kevin Powell, a web designer and educator. After watching some of his videos, I decided to experiment with drawing shapes using CSS and HTML. I thought it would be fun to try to recreate the iconic logo of YouTube using only these tools.

I started by sketching out the basic shapes of the logo and thinking about how I could create them using CSS borders and other techniques. I experimented with different percentages and positioning techniques, and gradually refined my design until I was happy with the final result. It also included the logo with pause and stop instead of only the usual play. This improved my understanding of positioning in CSS.

In this project, I've included the HTML and CSS code I used to create the YouTube logo, along with some notes and comments to help explain the process. I hope that this code can be a useful reference for others who are learning CSS and HTML, and that it can inspire more creativity and experimentation in web design.
